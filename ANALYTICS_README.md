## üóÑÔ∏è Database Structure

### Tables Created

1. **`views`** - Main view count table
   - `slug`: Blog post identifier
   - `count`: Total view count
   - `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps

2. **`view_analytics`** - Detailed analytics data
   - `slug`: Blog post identifier
   - `viewer_ip`: Visitor's IP address
   - `user_agent`: Browser/device information
   - `referrer`: Where visitor came from
   - `device_type`: Mobile, desktop, tablet
   - `browser`: Browser name and version
   - `os`: Operating system
   - `is_unique`: Whether this is a unique view
   - `session_id`: Unique session identifier

3. **`daily_views`** - Aggregated daily statistics
   - `slug`: Blog post identifier
   - `date`: Date of views
   - `total_views`: Total views for that day
   - `unique_views`: Unique views for that day

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `database-setup.sql`
4. Run the script to create all tables, functions, and triggers

### 2. Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set in your `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install recharts
```

## üìä How It Works

### View Tracking

1. **Automatic Detection**: The system automatically detects:
   - Device type (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera)
   - Operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS)
   - Referrer information
   - Session tracking

2. **Unique View Logic**: A view is considered unique if:
   - Same IP address hasn't viewed the same post within 24 hours
   - This prevents spam and provides accurate unique visitor counts

3. **Real-time Updates**: View counts update immediately when someone visits a blog post

### Analytics Collection

- **Page Load**: When someone visits a blog post, analytics data is automatically collected
- **Data Processing**: The system processes and stores:
  - View count increment
  - Device and browser information
  - Geographic data (if available)
  - Session tracking
- **Aggregation**: Daily statistics are automatically calculated and stored

## üéØ Admin Dashboard

### Access

Navigate to `/admin/analytics` to view the analytics dashboard.

### Dashboard Features

1. **Overview Cards**
   - Total views across all posts
   - Unique visitors today
   - Total number of blog posts

2. **Top Performing Posts**
   - Ranked list of most popular content
   - View counts for each post

3. **Device Distribution**

   - Total vs. unique view comparisons

5. **Individual Post Analytics**
   - Detailed charts for specific posts
   - Daily view trends
   - Device and browser breakdowns

## üîß API Endpoints

- `GET /api/views/[slug]` - Get current view count

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Views not incrementing**
   - Check Supabase connection
   - Verify environment variables
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Analytics dashboard not loading**
   - Ensure all database tables exist
   - Check API endpoint responses
   - Verify recharts library is installed

3. **Database errors**
   - Run verification queries from the SQL script
   - Check Supabase logs
   - Ensure RLS policies are correctly set

### Debug Queries

```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name IN ('views', 'view_analytics', 'daily_views');

-- Check recent analytics data
SELECT * FROM view_analytics ORDER BY viewed_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check view counts
SELECT * FROM views ORDER BY count DESC;
```
