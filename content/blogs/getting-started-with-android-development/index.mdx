Android development is an exciting field, but it can feel overwhelming when you're just starting out. Here are some practical habits and modern tools to help you succeed:

## 1. Master Android Studio Shortcuts
Learn the most common shortcuts in Android Studio to refactor, navigate, and code faster. [Official Cheatsheet](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/keyboard-shortcuts)

## 2. Use Emulators Wisely
Use multiple device profiles in the Android Emulator to ensure your app works smoothly everywhere. Save common setups for quick access.

## 3. Automate Builds and Tests
Set up simple Gradle tasks or GitHub Actions to automate builds and run your test suite—saving you time and catching bugs early.

## 4. Break Work into Tiny Tasks
Write a short TODO list before you start. Focus on small, actionable items rather than vague big goals.

## 5. Never Stop Learning
The Android ecosystem evolves fast! Dedicate 10–15 minutes a day to reading release notes, blog posts, or sample projects like those at [Awesome Android](https://github.com/JStumpp/awesome-android).
