Most developers know the feeling: the workday ends and you wonder, “where did all my time go?” Improving productivity isn’t just about working harder — it’s about working smarter, with the right habits in place.

## 1. Start with a Plan

Before you open your code editor, jot down your top 3 priorities for the day. This helps you focus on what matters, not just what’s urgent.

## 2. Use Keyboard Shortcuts

Spend a few minutes learning the key shortcuts of your editor or IDE. For example, [VS Code cheatsheet](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf) can help you perform common actions twice as fast.

## 3. Automate the Boring Stuff

Automate repetitive tasks using scripts. For example:

```bash
# A simple bash script to build and deploy your project
npm run build && npm run deploy
```

Not only will this save time, but it also reduces errors.

## 4. Take Meaningful Breaks

Don’t code for hours without a break. Use the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique): 25 minutes focus, 5 minutes break, repeat.

## 5. Keep Learning

Set aside 15 minutes every day to learn something new. Read blogs, watch a video, or try a coding challenge.
