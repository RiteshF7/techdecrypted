## About Me

Hi, I'm Ritesh Singh Sohlot — a Software Development Engineer with over 7 years of experience in Android development. I thrive in fast-paced startup environments where ownership, impact, and thoughtful design matter. My expertise includes scalable architecture, Jetpack Compose, Kotlin, CI/CD pipelines, and building motion-rich, latency-sensitive applications.

I'm passionate about technology and the Android ecosystem. Whether it's exploring advanced Compose APIs, optimizing performance, or mentoring engineers, I treat my work as a craft and a source of purpose. I love building things—especially when they make life smoother, smarter, or more delightful.

Few are blessed to live their passion as their profession. I consider it a privilege—and one I refuse to waste. I aim to become one of the greats, and I won’t stop until I do.
